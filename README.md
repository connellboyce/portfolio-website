### Description
This is my own personal website and portfolio. It will contain my resume, contact forms, summaries of projects I have 
completed, and more. <br>
I will be hosting this website to serve as my contact point for freelance work as well as my own self-advertisement. My 
goal with this website and portfolio is to have a place where I can publish information about myself, detail my 
accomplishments, and potentially even host a personal blog.
